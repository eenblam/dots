# Dotfiles
These are just the various dot files I like to have handy when setting up a new Linux machine.

If you want to try out the environment, just clone the dots repo to wherever and symlink to the files in ~ using `ln -s /path/to/dots/dots/.whatever`.

The dotfiles are actually kept in the nested folder, `dots/dots`, so that the adventurous can symlink everything at once without also symlinking `.git`. You probably like your `.bashrc`, though, so ~~be careful~~ use `ln -sb ...`.
